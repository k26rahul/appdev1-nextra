## Lectures

### L1.1: What is an App?

- **I. Introduction to Applications**

  - App: software/program.

- **II. Types of Applications**

  - Desktop Applications
    - Standalone.
    - Notepad, VS Code, Chrome, VLC, WhatsApp Desktop.
  - Mobile Applications
    - Apps downloaded from app stores (Play Store).
    - Better Internet connectivity.
    - Constraints: memory, processing power, battery.
    - WhatsApp Mobile app.
  - Web Applications
    - Dynamic and interactive.
    - Common platform across OS.
    - WhatsApp Web (web.whatsapp.com).
  - Embedded Applications
    - Smart fridge, Smart POS system.

- **III. Development Frameworks**

  - Software Development Kits (SDKs)
    - Tools that simplify application development; reduce low-level details.
    - .NET, Electron, React Native, Flutter, JavaFX.
  - Cross-Platform Development
    - Develop for multiple OS.

- **IV. User Interaction**
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    - Uses mouse or touch; has icons and visual elements like buttons.
  - Command Line Interface (CLI)
    - Terminal for commands.
  - Other Interaction Mechanisms
    - Voice, Gestures.

### L1.2: Components of an App

- **Storage**

  - Where data is stored (cloud, local).
  - Gmail uses cloud storage.

- **Computation**

  - Manipulating data.
  - Email indexing for search.

- **Presentation**

  - Displaying data to users.
  - Formatting, rendering emails.

- **Platforms**

  - Desktop
    - Input: keyboard, mouse.
    - Desktop paradigm (files, folders).
  - Mobile
    - Input: touchscreen, voice, sensors.
    - Constraints: small self-contained apps, memory, processing power, battery.
  - Web-Based
    - Storage: data centers, access anywhere.
  - Embedded
    - Single-function devices.
    - Smart fridge, smart watch.

- **Examples of Embedded Devices**
  - Smart refrigerator (grocery orders).
  - Smart microwave oven.
  - Smart TV.

### L1.3: Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer Architecture

- **Client-Server Architecture**

  - Components: server, clients, network.
  - Server stores data, responds to requests.
  - Clients request data based on user interactions.
  - Network connects clients to server.
  - If the central server fails, the entire system is down.
  - Examples:
    - Web servers: serve content to clients.
    - Email servers: store emails; clients display them.
    - Database servers: provide data to client applications.
    - Gmail Android app: client displays emails stored on the server.
    - Browsers: clients that request and display web content.

- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**
  - All nodes are peers, no clear client/server distinction.
  - Example: BitTorrent allows users to both download and upload files.
  - Tolerant to failures; new nodes can be introduced without a central controller.
  - Examples:
    - BitTorrent: file sharing.
    - Blockchain: distributed trust systems.
    - Distributed file systems: data stored across devices, often encrypted.
    - WebRTC: enables peer-to-peer connections for real-time communication.

### L1.4: Software Architectures

- **Design Patterns**

  - Reusable solutions to common software problems.
  - Save time, improve code quality.

- **Example of MVC (Model-View-Controller)**

  - **Model**: Storage part of application (e.g., emails, messages, files).
    - Indexed for manipulation, stored in database or memory.
  - **View**: Presentation part of application.
    - Multiple views for the same data.
    - Can be audio or other formats.
  - **Controller**: Business logic part of application.
    - Manages user interactions.
    - Manipulates model (e.g., sort, delete).

- **Feedback Loop**
  - User manipulates model via controller.
  - Model updates view.

```
     +-------------+
     |    View     |
     +-------------+
           ↑
           | Updates
           |
     +-------------+
     | Controller  |
     +-------------+
           |
           | Manipulates
           ↓
     +-------------+
     |    Model    |
     +-------------+
```

- **Origins of MVC**

  - Developed in Smalltalk (1979).
  - Separates concerns in complex apps.

- **Alternatives to MVC**

  - Other patterns exist (e.g., Model View Adapter, Model View Presenter).
  - Specific use cases.

- **Course Focus**
  - Web-based app development.
  - Client-server architecture.
  - MVC.

### L1.5: Introduction to the Web

- Introduction to the web as a platform, historical context, and networking concepts

  - **Cross-platform**: Works on any OS. Any device. Common interface for users.
  - **Efficiency**: Optimizes costs, storage, networking.

- Evolution of Networks

  - **Circuit-switched networks**: Direct path for calls. Inefficient use of resources.
  - **Packet-switched networks**: Data split into packets. Flexible routing. Works for all data types: voice, text, video.

- Internet History

  - **ARPANET**: Early network. Connected nodes. Many incompatible protocols.
  - **Internet Protocol (IP)**: Standard communication method. Connects different networks.
  - **TCP/IP**: Reliable data transfer. Ensures flow control. Acknowledges received packets.

- DNS and Names

  - **IP Addresses**: Unique numerical identifiers. Hard to remember. Example: 192.168.1.1. It's 32 bits.
  - **DNS**: Domain Name System. Translates names (e.g., google.com) to IP addresses. Simplifies user access.

- Birth of the Web
  - **Hypertext**: Text links to other documents. Forms interconnected web of information.
  - **World Wide Web (WWW)**: Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. Uses hyperlinks for navigation.
